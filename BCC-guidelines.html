<ol><li>This would result in a Burst Finish as it takes time for a Bey to travel into a pocket and stop spinning to where it could not return whereas a fully separation Burst is instantaneous.</li></ol></li> <li>There are times when both Beys are in close proximity to the Over/Xtreme Zones that the Burst and the crossing of the threshold are not discernable.
<ol><li>This would result in a Relaunch as a clear winner was not discernable.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol></li> <li><em>Bey A falls onto its side and Bey B stops spinning, but Bey A has one quarter turn more due to having a conical shape and remnant inertia.</em> <ol><li>CobaltDragoon 5 or 6-60 Elevate is one example of this conical or round shape and would continue to spin into a Life after Death state after their opponent has stopped.</li> <li>Spin Finish, Bey A wins, 1 Point.</li></ol></li> <li>Blader A begins to pull their string before the word shoot is called, and decides to stop when they realize what they are doing and the Bey falls out of the Launcher hooks.
<ol><li>Launch Error</li> <li>Bey fell off the Hooks</li> <li>This is their first warning</li></ol></li> <li>Example: Blader B pulls their Winder Cord in a way which causes their launcher to swing downward during Launch causing their Bey to bounce off the X-line with inertia beyond design intent.
<ol><li>Launch error</li> <li>Blader B is using their Winder pull in a way which is creating external influence on the performance of the Bey.</li> <li>This is their second warning in the same Game which grants Blader A a Penalty Point.</li></ol></li></ol></li></ol> <h3 id="launch-errors-launch-errors"><a href="#launch-errors-launch-errors" class="header-anchor">#</a> Launch Errors {#launch-errors}</h3> <p>1.
