# **Regarding these Community Rules for Beyblade X** {#regarding-these-community-rules-for-beyblade-x}

1.  This is the second iteration of the formally named Rules and Regulations.  
2.  We've adapted the official Takara Tomy Rules and Regulations Vol 6 into our own version to implement at the State level of Ohio in the United States of America.  
3.  Rules will be adjusted as needed, and further still as updated by Takara Tomy.  
4.  While this was created to work alongside the WBO Ruleset, we understand there are differences in our approach to terminology as well as judgement. We will be providing examples of TT, BCC, and WBO rulings for certain situations.

 

* [Vol 6 Takara Tomy Rules](https://www.takaratomyasia.com/img/beybladex/1732149844_BEYBLADE%20X%20-%20REGULATION%206th%20Edition.pdf)  
* [Vol 5 Takara Tomy Rules](https://www.takaratomyasia.com/img/beybladex/1723518138_Regulation%20ver.5%20English%20ver..pdf)  
* [Vol 4 Takara Tomy Rules](https://www.takaratomyasia.com/img/beybladex/1711658048_BBX%20regulation%20Vol.4_Eng.pdf)

## **Regarding Game Equipment** {#regarding-game-equipment}

### The Beyblade or Bey {#the-beyblade-or-bey}

1.  A Beyblade, hereafter referred to as "Bey", is the term used to refer to the spinning top used in the game of Beyblade.  
2. This term refers to the Beyblade in its entirety, that is a complete and functional Beyblade combo in one functional form.  
3. A complete Beyblade within Beyblade X consists of a Blade, a Ratchet, and a Bit.   
4. In the CX system or Custom Line, a subsystem within the Beyblade X system, the Blade itself comes in 3 parts: a Lock Chip, a Main Blade, and an Assist Blade.  
5. Only Beyblade X Bey's released by Takara Tomy or Hasbro may be used for this format.

### The Launcher {#the-launcher}

1. A Launcher is used to Launch a Bey into a Stadium for Battle.  
   1. *String Launchers*  
      1. This type of Launcher uses a string mechanism which is retracted by a tightly wound internal coil.  
      2. String Launchers require a break in period where they must be used gently for the first 50 or so launches in order to prime the coil for higher speeds.  
   2. *Winder Launchers*  
      1. This type of Launcher uses an external plastic Winder, sometimes called a Ripcord.  
      2. Winder launchers do not require the same break in period due to a lack of internal coil.  
2. Any accessories attached to the Launcher are considered part of the Launcher and should not come into contact with any other parts.  
3. 3D Printed Launcher Grips are allowed within BCC on a case-by-case basis. Please see a Judge for approval of your 3D Printed Accessories.

### The Stadiums {#the-stadiums}

#### Stadium Components {#stadium-components}

1. Stadium Cover  
   1. *B Side of the Stadium*  
      1. This refers to the Left side of the Stadium, where the B in the Beyblade X logo is located on the Cover.  
   2. *X Side of the Stadium*  
      1. This refers to the Right side of the Stadium, where the X in the Beyblade X logo is located on the Cover.  
   3. *Launch Area*  
      1. Launcher's and Beys must be within the circular Launch Area at the beginning and end of the countdown, referred to as the Shooting area in the TT Ruleset.  
2. Stadium Body  
   1. *X Rail*  
      1. This refers to the Xtreme Line rail part fixed to the stadium body.  
   2. *Battle Zone*  
      1. This refers to the parts of the Xtreme Stadium Body other than the Over Zone and the Xtreme Zone.  
   3. *Over Zone*  
      1. This refers to the two pockets located at the Front Left and Front Right of the Xtreme Stadium.  
   4. *Xtreme Zone*  
      1. This refers to the opening located at the Center Front of the Xtreme Stadium.

#### Out of Bounds {#out-of-bounds}

1. When a Bey is struck in the middle of Battle and is launched out and through the Launch Area in reverse, this places the Bey Out of Bounds.  
   1. *To be out of Bounds is to be beyond the Stadium components.*  
      1. Not in the pockets  
      2. Not in the Stadium  
      3. Not on the Cover Launch area lip  
      4. Possibly in the Stadium container or on the floor

####  Stadium Containers {#stadium-containers}

1. These are made of Cardboard and confirmed to be level **before** and **after** every tournament day.  
   1. *18"x18"x1" for TT-X Stadiums*  
   2. *14"x18"x1" for Hasbro-X Stadiums*  
   3. *A 18x18x18 Heavy Duty Medium Box from Lowes is $5 and will allow you to make 4 Containers.*

#### Securing a Stadium to the container for Play {#securing-a-stadium-to-the-container-for-play}

1. 2"x10"x1" length of Polyurethane foam  
   1.  *This mimics the paper enclosure used in official Japanese tournaments by providing minimal recoil due to the foam crumpling and reforming in a slow rather than reactive way.*   
2. Using Tape or any other form of adhering the Stadium to a container will change the properties of the Stadium and negatively impact the performance of Beys.

#### Stadium Stands {#stadium-stands}

1. 24x26x18 B4 Regulation Height  
2. Not available under $80 per Stand from USA based custom manufacturers.  
3. We do not recommend using any platform taller than 28" to keep the game accessible to Bladers 8 and up.

## **Regarding Organized Play** {#regarding-organized-play}

1. All tournaments are run by BCC Organizers who must meet our **Organized Play** standards. Each sanctioned event upholds the structure and spirit that define BCC competition**.**;  
   1. *Bracket Check-in*  
      1. Blader Check-in  
      2. Deck Registration

   2. *Typically, Bladers will play a Bo3 then alternate out to allow the next blader to play if there are limited Stadiums.*

## **Regarding Battle** {#regarding-battle}

### Tournament-Match Hierarchy {#tournament-match-hierarchy}

Tournament  Round\>Match Up, between Bladers\> Game, up to an amount of Points or Games for a given Tournament Round\> Battle

1. A Match consists of one or more Games, typically played as a Best-of-1 or Best-of-3 format.  
   1. *Example: “The Match between Blader A and Blader B will be Best of 3 Games.”*  
2. Each Game continues until one Blader reaches the required number of points (e.g., 4 points).  
   1. *Example: “Game 1 between Blader A and Blader B was really even—each Battle rebalanced the scores to 6–6 before a final burst decided it.”*  
3.  A Battle is a single round of launches, with both Bladers launching once. A Battle results in points awarded by a clear and definitive Winner of the Battle.  
   1.  *Example: “Blader A launched from the same side in Battle 1 and Battle 3 due to the stadium being rotated after each point. That side clearly suited their style better.”*  
   2. *Example: "Blader A had to relaunch three times in Battle 1 due to repeated Launch Errors but by Game 3, they were able to dial down their launch to land successfully"*

### Regarding Battle Sequencing {#regarding-battle-sequencing}

1. The match begins when both Bladers and Judge arrive at the table.  
2. Bladers present disassembled equipment for Judge Inspection.  
3. The Judge visually inspects each part for  
   1. Part authenticity  
   2. Modifications  
   3. Part Wear  
4. The Judge returns equipment to Bladers  
5. Bladers assemble their beys and place them in their Deck Box to finalize their Deck Order.  
6. The Judge prompts Bladers to reveal their first slot Bey and the Launcher they intend to use.  
7. Bladers allow their opponent to visually inspect the Bey and can ask any questions to their opponent or Judge at this time.  
8. Bladers are prompted to Ready themselves with a call  
   1. “Bladers Ready?”  
9. Bladers mount their Bey on their Launcher and ready themselves.  
10. The Judge confirms they have no bystanders around them who might get hurt and calls   
    1. “Clear to Launch\!”  
       1. *The Judge can provide a preview of how they will be counting at the Blader’s request.*  
          1. The BCC promotes a steady 1-beat count, not fast, not slow.  
          2. Example of a 5 Beat:  
             1. Beat..Beat..Beat..Beat..Beat  
             2. 3..2..1..Go..Shoot  
11. The Judge then begins the countdown while the Launch area is clear and Bladers are ready. 3..2..1..Go..SHOOT.  
12. Bladers must begin their Pull at the call of the word SHOOT  
    1. Not Go  
    2. Not GOShoot  
13. A Battle round commences until a clear and definitive winner of the Battle is determined.  
14. The Judge will remove the Winning Bey from the Stadium and announce it as the Winner, as well as assigning Points dependent on Battle Results.  
15.  The Stadium is cleared of any Beys or debris and beys are returned to their slots  
    1. Bladers can sometimes place their used Beys outside of their Box to help them remember what Beys remain in the Game for that Game Round.

### Regarding Battle Results {#regarding-battle-results}

1. Points  
   1. *Xtreme Finish 2 Points*  
   2. *Burst Finish 2 Points*  
   3. *Over Finish 1 Point*  
   4. *Spin Finish 1 Point*  
2. Penalty Points  
   1. *Two Consecutive Launch Errors within the same Game rewards 1 Penalty Point to the Blader who successfully launched and landed within the Battle Zone.*  
   2. *Further Consecutive Launch errors continue to reward points.*  
3. Examples  
   1. *Bey A Bursts whereas Bey B is launched into a Pocket.*  
      1. Burst Finish, Bey B Wins, 2 Points.  
         1. There are times when a Bey will Burst as it strikes the opponent, this is considered a Moment of Impact(MoI).  
            1.  At the Moment of Impact, a Bey can ricochet towards a Pocket.  
            2. If a Bey Bursts at the MoI, this is considered a Burst Finish.  
         2. If a Bey Bursts at the MoI while it's opponent is sent flying into the Over Zone or Xtreme Zone  
            1. This would result in a Burst Finish as it takes time for a Bey to travel into a pocket and stop spinning to where it could not return whereas a fully separation Burst is instantaneous.  
         3. There are times when both Beys are in close proximity to the Over/Xtreme Zones that the Burst and the crossing of the threshold are not discernable.  
            1. This would result in a Relaunch as a clear winner was not discernable.  
   2. *Bey A falls onto its side and Bey B stops spinning, but Bey A has one quarter turn more due to having a conical shape and remnant inertia.*   
      1. CobaltDragoon 5 or 6-60 Elevate is one example of this conical or round shape and would continue to spin into a Life after Death state after their opponent has stopped.   
      2. Spin Finish, Bey A wins, 1 Point.  
   3. Blader A begins to pull their string before the word shoot is called, and decides to stop when they realize what they are doing and the Bey falls out of the Launcher hooks.  
      1.  Launch Error  
      2. Bey fell off the Hooks  
      3. This is their first warning  
   4. Example: Blader B pulls their Winder Cord in a way which causes their launcher to swing downward during Launch causing their Bey to bounce off the X-line with inertia beyond design intent.   
      1. Launch error  
      2. Blader B is using their Winder pull in a way which is creating external influence on the performance of the Bey.   
      3. This is their second warning in the same Game which grants Blader A a Penalty Point.

         2. The Bey falls from the Launcher during count down  
      2. Blader Malfunction  
         1. The Bey has a clearly slow rotation due to some other external factor that took the Blader's attention
